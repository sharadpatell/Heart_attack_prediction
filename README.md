# Heart_attack_prediction

## Overview

This project uses machine learning models to predict the risk of heart attacks based on patient health parameters. It focuses on accuracy and model performance evaluation.

## Dataset

- Contains patient information and health attributes.
- Binary output classes: 0 (no heart attack risk) and 1 (heart attack risk).
- 289 rows, 14 columns.

## Preprocessing

- Handled missing values and treated outliers in trtbps, chol, and oldpeak.

## EDA (Exploratory Data Analysis)

- Visualized data relationships using bar plots, histograms, and pivot tables.

## Models

Implemented models:

- Logistic Regression
- K-Nearest Neighbors
- Naive Bayes
- Support Vector Classification
- XGBoost

## Performance

Evaluated models with metrics like accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score. Calculated ROC AUC score for model comparison.

## Conclusion

Best model achieved an accuracy of [accuracy score] and F1-score of [F1-score].
